 *
 * I use Stack to store directed left children from root.
 When next() is called, I just pop one element and process its right child as new root.
 The code is pretty straightforward.

 So this can satisfy O(h) memory, hasNext() in O(1) time,
 But next() is O(h) time.

 I canâ€™t find a solution that can satisfy both next() in O(1) time, space in O(h).

 answer:
 The average time complexity of next() function is O(1) indeed in your case. As the next function can be called n times at most,
 and the number of right nodes in self.pushAll(tmpNode.right) function is maximal n in a tree which has n nodes, so the amortized time complexity is O(1).
