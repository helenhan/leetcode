/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hit-counter/discuss/83483/Super-easy-design-O(1)-hit()-O(s)-getHits()-no-fancy-data-structure-is-needed!?page=1
 * O(s) s is total seconds in given time interval, in this case 300.
 basic ideal is using buckets. 1 bucket for every second because we only need to keep the recent hits info for 300 seconds.
 hit[] array is wrapped around by mod operation. Each hit bucket is associated with times[] bucket which record current time.
 If it is not current time, it means it is 300s or 600sâ€¦ ago and need to reset to 1.
